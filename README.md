## Hey, I'm Manolo! 👋🏻

### Full-Stack Software Engineer 👨🏻‍💻

I've been involved in the world of software engineering for the past 6+ years, doing everything from developing corporate software to working as a freelance web developer. My main focus right now is centered on strengthening my Front-End skills while also starting my journey in the world of 2D and 3D game development.

Here are a few things to know about me:

- 🔨 One of my current personal projects is about my new personal website, built on Vite ⚡ & React ⚛
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Angular, React and Godot Engine.
- 💬 Ask me anything about videogames, cooking and birds.
- 💙 Always open to connecting! Reach me out on [in/manoloramos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manoloramos/)
- 👀 Some random facts: 
  - I always carry an umbrella in my backpack, no matter the weather.
  - Hard for me to imagine a world without seedless grapes. They are just so awesome 😎
  - My signature dish is curry chicken w/ rice.
  - I'm an avid reader, specially for the fantasy genre. Currently reading *The Wise Man's Fear*, from Patrick Rothfuss (~~release that damn third book, please~~).
